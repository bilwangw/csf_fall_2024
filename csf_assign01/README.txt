Bill Wang, Ryan Wu

We split the work evenly. Ryan mainly did the constructors
destructor, assignment operator, git_bits, and Bill mainly 
did get_bit_vector, is_negative, operator-, to_hex. 
For milestone 2 we collaborated for each part. Both of us
met up and programed on one computer while we worked through
the solution.

We wrote a test case for unary minus. We added two helper 
functions: one to test for overflow, and one to test if a 
BigInt was zero.

For our bit shift operator, we used a much simpler, but
probably much less efficient algorithm.
